TODO


- mount win share on linux -> install NTFS on windows server
- store original file name (parts) in metadata as an option
- limit max amount of data processed at any time (process in batch if more than > 1000)
- ASYNC duplication problem?

OK - don't start the tagger if already tagged the files
OK - how to deal with duplicate imports?
OK - if can't get date from file name, try getting month and year from exiftool in php-filesorter
OK - php-filesorter send each metadata object with echo to node, in node process each object and append to internal array
OK - integrate tagging of the files with exiftool
