TODO

- mount win share on linux -> install NTFS on windows server
- if can't get date from file name, try getting month and year from exiftool in php-filesorter
- how to deal with duplicate imports?
- store original file name in metadata
- limit max amount of data processed at any time (process in batch if more than > 1000)

OK - php-filesorter send each metadata object with echo to node, in node process each object and append to internal array
OK - integrate tagging of the files with exiftool
